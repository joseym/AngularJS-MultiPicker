AngularJS-MultiPicker
=====================

> __Update__ This is one of my earliest attempts at a directive and it's weak in a lot of areas. Feel free to fork and make it better. What we have here is simple and it solved the problem I was having.

> MultiDatesPicker is the creation of [@dubrox](https://github.com/dubrox) and its repo can be found [here](https://github.com/dubrox/Multiple-Dates-Picker-for-jQuery-UI)
